      HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, link or images. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language created to style the appearance of contentâ€”using, for example, fonts or colors.
      JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. i.e. dynamically create content, update content, control multimedia, animate images, and heaps more. The two HTML and CSS languages are independent of one another and should remain that way. CSS
      should not be written inside of an HTML document and vice versa. As a rule, HTML will always represent content, CSS will always represent the appearance of that content and Javascript dynamically changes both HTMl and CSS.
